- Page 10: The last sentence should start "It also seems clear" instead of "In also seems clear". (voberholzer)
- Page 36: In the caption to Figure 3.4, it should read "`roadways` is mapped to size", instead of "`educ` is mapped to size." (gmontoya)
- Page 65: The `filter()` command on the `start` variable at the bottom of the page does not work as intended. The argument should be `start > "1973-01-01"`. ([sschmidt](https://github.com/mdsr-book/mdsr-book.github.io/issues/15))
- Page 90: At the end of Exercise 4.16, the following sentence should be added: "Use the `Births78` data set from the `mosaicData` package as a reference." (nhorton/bbaumer)

    library(mdsr)
    Votes_wide <- Votes %>%
      tidyr::spread(key = bill, value = vote)
    ```
