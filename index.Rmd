*Modern Data Science with R* is a comprehensive **data science textbook** for undergraduates that incorporates statistical and computational thinking to solve real-world problems with data. Rather than focus exclusively on case studies or programming syntax, this book illustrates how statistical programming in the state-of-the-art R/RStudio computing environment  can be leveraged to extract meaningful information from a variety of data in the service of addressing compelling statistical questions. 

Contemporary data science requires a tight integration of knowledge from statistics, computer science, mathematics, and a domain of application. This book will help readers with some background in statistics and modest prior experience with coding develop and practice the appropriate skills to tackle complex data science projects. The book features a number of exercises and has a flexible organization conducive to teaching a variety of semester courses.

"The book is unique. It is an encyclopedia of Data Science, and it covers a wide variety of modern topics; another positive aspect is that it contains lots of examples and code, and the layout is quite catchy. One can learn (and teach) subjects as diverse as: How to give talks, administrating databases, how to model spatial data, and even ethics---all in one book." (Miguel de Carvalho, The University of Edinburgh)
